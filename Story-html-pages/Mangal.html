        <h2>The Wrath Of Mars</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            The story of Narasimha, that is half lion and half man, also known as the fourth 
            form of Lord Vishnu, holds a significance and represents Mars. Hiranyakashipu, who 
            was a demon king, deeply loathed Vishnu for killing his brother and was creating an 
            army to defeat lord Vishnu. He also killed numerous Vishnu devotees. But the actual 
            problem in Hiranyakashipu's life started when his own son, Prahlad turned out to be an admirer 
            of Vishnu.  In his childhood somebody had narrated a parable of Vishnu to Prahlad and 
            ever since he started worshipping. As he was opposing his father's ideologies, firstly 
            Hiranyakashipu tried stopping him and later on took steps to punish and even kill him. 
            But everytime lord Vishnu would save the child. Furious, Hiranyakashipu asks Prahalad 
            where his Vishnu is, to which Prahlad replies,"he is everywhere, including the pillar
            behind you". An angry Hiranyakashipu breaks the pillar just to find Vishnu in his 
            Narasimha avatar, who is extremely angry at Hiranyakashipu. This powerful avatar kills
            the demon king by tearing his stomach from the center.

            This avatar is related to Mars, as just like Narsimha, if Mars gets clarity in his 
            life then he can drive his entire energy, aggression, and masculine power towards 
            achieving it. It is a very angry planet.
