        <h2>Vamana Avatar Guru: Jupiter</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            The planet Jupiter is linked to the story of Vamana avatar of lord Vishnu. Mahabali was 
            a kind ruler, who always kept his kingdom and people happy and satisfied. It is also 
            said that he had the possession of the Amrit which was used to save him during a war. 
            And being immortal, he was able to conquer the heaven and earth by winning multiple 
            wars. Shukracharya had told Bali to perform hundred yajnas after which he would make 
            him the god of heaven, giving him the position of Indra dev. When this news reached the 
            other gods they approached lord Vishnu asking for his help, as they knew how powerful Bali 
            was. Vishnu took the form of a mendicant and went to Bali. Shukracharya instantly 
            recognised that it was lord Vishnu in a vaman avatar. Vaman means dwarf. 
            Shukracharya tried to stop him, but vaman went to king Bali and asked for three steps of
            land. Bali was a generous king and even though Shukracharya stopped him from listening to 
            the vaman, he still granted the wish. Vishnu suddenly grew in size, in one step he covered 
            the earth and in the second one the heaven, then he asked Bali as to where should he put 
            his foot for the third step to which Bali replied "on my head Prabhu". Bali followed 
            Shukracharya's advice of always helping his people and serve them and did not back off 
            from helping the Vaman, even when he knew it was Vishnu and that he would not be able to
            take the position of Indra dev, the god of heaven. He stuck to the teachings of his guru,
            because of which he was made the ruler of Jupiter and he guides the world with his knowledge.
