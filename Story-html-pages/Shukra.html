        <h2>The luxuries Of Venus</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            The soft beautiful planet popular for its ability to give luxury is a depiction of 
            the Parashuram avatar of lord Vishnu. This was his sixth form. The story goes like 
            this, once a Kshatriya king visits Parashuram's home, where he is not present at the 
            moment and his father attends to the king and his army. The rishi (Parashuram's father) 
            prepares the food for the king and his army very smoothly with the help of his cow, 
            named Kamadhenu. Seeing how useful the cow was the king demanded that the rishi give it
            to him. Upon denying, the king killed the rishi by stabbing him 21 times and took the cow 
            to his palace. When Parashuram returned home to this devastating event he killed the king. 
            Then he went around the earth 21 times and killed every Kshatriya king who was 
            troubling or torturing his subjects and appointed new kings in their place. That is why 
            it is said that Venus makes you a king by giving you all the luxuries in your life. 
            Also it is said that in order to make your Venus strong, it is a good practice to serve food and 
            respect cows.
