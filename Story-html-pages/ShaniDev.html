        <h2>Your Karma lies with Shani Dev</h2>
    </div>

            If I had to talk about the most feared planet in astrology then it would definitely 
            be number 8. Shani Dev the god of the planet Saturn is known for rewarding people 
            for their good as well as bad deeds. But Shani Dev is not bad at heart. He is just 
            misunderstood by everyone, even his own father Surya Dev. The Sun god was married to 
            a beautiful woman Saranyu and had three children with her. Saranyu loved her children 
            but she couldn't bear the luminous outlook as he was too bright for her eyes. She had 
            her plans of going to the forest and do penance but needed somebody to look after her 
            children. So, she created her own shadow and requested her to nurture her family. This 
            shadow embodiment was named Chaya. Chaya was a good wife and mother and not for once 
            did Surya Dev doubt her to not be his real wife. When she was expecting a baby, being 
            a devotee of Lord Shiva, she was so engrossed in penance that she did not care to eat 
            and prayed in the burning sun, leading to her child being born with a dark skin tone. 
            This child was Shani Dev. Surya Dev did not want to accept Shani as his child as he had 
            a bright body and his son was dark. He even accused Chaya of not being a loyal wife. 
            The Sun god turned bitter towards his son and insulted his wife, a young Shani Dev 
            could not bear it and as his sight laid on his father, Surya's radiance decreased.
            When Surya Dev ran to lord Shiva to seek help, Shiva explained to him the truth about 
            Shani. Surya Dev then apologised to his son and regained his beauty.

            People despise Saturn for it is a slow planet and they receive the fruits of their hardwork 
            very late. But Shani Dev only tests your patience and once he has confirmed that you are 
            honest and never give up he will reward you abundantly. If you have read the Sagar Manthan 
            Svarbhanu story in my stories section then I would like to add to that incident. The 
            mountain was sinking in the ocean and lord Vishnu had taken the form of a large tortoise to 
            hold the weight of the mountain on his back. This avatar represents Shani Dev as it bore all 
            the burden on itself, and the tortoise is slow just like the planet Saturn, but if you work 
            hard and do not give up, the Amrit is yours!
