        <h2>The God Of Intellect: Mercury</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            The most intellectual planet, who does not cause any inconvenience to those who worship
            him, has his own tragic backstory. Once, Chandra dev decided to perform a yagna and 
            asked Brihaspati(Jupiter) to be his main priest. Due to some reason Jupiter could not 
            attend the event and sent his wife Tara as a representative from his side. During the 
            ritual Chandra dev's beauty kept increasing, attracting all the females towards him, 
            including Tara. She returned home enceinte and upon being questioned said that it was 
            Moon's child. Upon hearing this, Jupiter cursed the child to be genderless. This child 
            was none other than Mercury. Mercury meditated upon Lord Narayan who blessed him with 
            abundant beauty and intelligence. In the following years, an apsara was attracted to him, 
            and was ready to give herself to him, but Buddh remembered how such engagement had negatively 
            affected his life referencing to Chandra Dev's fault and hence turned down the apsara's 
            proposal, enraged she cursed him to be an eunuch.

        <p>
            The conjunction of Moon and Mercury is not considered a very favourable one. Hence, 
            a birth number 2 and life path 5 for example do not go very well together and is said to 
            waste your potential or intelligence. But Mercury is the planet of communication and 
            intelligence and it also maintains a good balance with the other planets. If you do not 
            have a number 5 in your entire birth date at all then stick to eating and using green 
            color in you life.
