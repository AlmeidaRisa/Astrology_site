        <h2>Sagar Manthan: Svarbhanu(Rahu-Ketu)</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Let us understand the story behind Rahu and Ketu by understanding the infamous 
            Samudra Manthan that is mentioned in the Vishnu Purana. The Samudra Manthana occurred
             after the curse of short-tempered Maharishi Durvasa to Indra Dev. All the ratnas 
             including Amrit(the elixir Of Immortality) were sinking in an ocean and in order to
              retrieve them all the gods went to Lord Vishnu for help. In order to obtain Amrit the 
              Churning of the ocean began, but this required opposite energies, hence along with gods
              even demons' help was required. The Mandara mountain was used to churn the ocean of
              milk and Vasuki naag was used as a rope between the gods and demons. 14 ratnas were extracted 
              and alas came the Amrit. Now, everyone wanted a drop of it. But to prevent the demons from
              consuming it, Lord Vishnu took the avatar of a beautiful woman Mohini and asked the demons
              to clean themselves before having the ratna. All the demons, except one listened to Mohini.
              This one demon named Svarbhanu took the form of a dev and drank a drop of Amrit. When Bhagwan 
              Vishnu realised this he tried to kill Svarbhanu with his chakra, but he was already 
              immortal. But the chakra beheaded him forming Rahu(the head) and Ketu(the body). One 
              must know that these are the shadows of Moon or shadow planets in Astrology. The Sun and 
              the Moon gods were the ones who alerted about Svarbhanu's sneaking, creating a hatred 
              between Rahu-Sun and Ketu-Moon.

            Hence, people with Rahu as their ruler often tend to think differently or out of the box
            compared to the world around them, but things often don't go as planned for them. Just like 
            Svarbhanu out of all the demons decided to come up with a jugaad but in the end was beheaded 
            by Vishnu bhagvan. If Rahu is attachment then Ketu represents detachment. It is also the 
            planet of spirituality, and people governed by ketu are normally seen to be extremely 
            spiritual.
